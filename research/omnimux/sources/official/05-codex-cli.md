Overview

OmniMux uses a single gateway Base URL: https://api.omnimux.ai (OpenAI-compatible clients typically use https://api.omnimux.ai/v1). Console: omnimux.ai/dashboard. Model IDs in this guide are examples — confirm with the console or GET /v1/models.

Codex CLI is OpenAI’s official command-line tool for code-related tasks in the terminal. Compared to general chat tools, it emphasizes engineering-ready output with clearer, actionable code changes.
By integrating Codex CLI with OmniMux API, you can access OmniMux’s models (such as GPT series) through a unified OpenAI-compatible interface with one key and one base URL.

​

Prerequisites

Before configuring, make sure you have:

​

1. Install Node.js and npm

Why needed? Node.js is the runtime environment for CLI tools (like installing WeChat on your phone to chat, you need to install Node.js on your computer to run CLI tools).
If already installed: Run node -v and npm -v to check version. If v20+, skip this step.
First-time installation:

Download and install from Node.js official website (recommend LTS version)

If you’re unfamiliar with the installation process, refer to Runoob - Node.js Installation Guide

Recommended: Node.js v20 or higher

Verify installation:

node -v
npm -v

​

2. Get OmniMux API Key

Log in to OmniMux Console

Find API Keys in the dashboard, click ‘Create New Key’ button, then copy the generated Key

API Key usually starts with sk-

​

Step 1: Install Codex CLI

Tip: If you don’t know how to open a command line terminal, see FAQ - How to open command line terminal

​

1. Global Installation

npm install -g @openai/codex

Expected result: Download info scrolling, ending with added XX packages (takes 1-3 minutes).
If error occurs: permission denied means Windows needs “Run as administrator” PowerShell, macOS/Linux add sudo before command.

​

2. Verify Installation

codex --version

Success indicator: Shows version number (e.g., 1.x.x).

​

Step 2: Configure OmniMux API

Codex CLI supports a custom Provider via config file, no source code modification needed.

​

1. Open Config Directory

Press Win + R, paste the following, then press Enter to open the Codex config directory:

%userprofile%\.codex

In Finder, press Command + Shift + G, paste the following path, then press Enter:

~/.codex

Access the config directory in your file manager:

~/.codex

​

2. Edit config.toml

Find the config.toml file in the config directory and edit it with the following content:

model = "gpt-5.2"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
model_provider = "omnimux"

[model_providers.omnimux]
name = "OmniMux API"
base_url = "https://api.omnimux.ai/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"

⚠️ Important:

Copy completely without missing any symbols

Replace "your-omnimux-api-key" with actual API Key

TOML format is sensitive to indentation and symbols

@"
model = "gpt-5.2"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
model_provider = "omnimux"

[model_providers.omnimux]
name = "OmniMux API"
base_url = "https://api.omnimux.ai/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
"@ | Out-File -FilePath "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\config.toml" -Encoding utf8

cat > ~/.codex/config.toml << 'EOF'
model = "gpt-5.2"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
model_provider = "omnimux"

[model_providers.omnimux]
name = "OmniMux API"
base_url = "https://api.omnimux.ai/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
EOF

After running the command, the config file will be automatically created and written.

model = "gpt-5.2"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
model_provider = "omnimux"

[model_providers.omnimux]
name = "OmniMux API"
base_url = "https://api.omnimux.ai/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"

Config fields:

model: default model name

model_reasoning_effort: reasoning depth (adjust as needed)

model_provider: provider name that matches the section below

base_url: OmniMux API endpoint

env_key: environment variable name for the API key

wire_api: must be responses

​

2. Configure API Key

Temporary (current session only)

$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-omnimux-api-key"

Permanent

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your-omnimux-api-key", "User")

Restart the terminal for changes to take effect.
Verify Configuration

echo $env:OPENAI_API_KEY

If it outputs your API Key, the configuration is successful.
Temporary (current session only)

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-omnimux-api-key"

Permanent
Edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc, add:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-omnimux-api-key"

Then run source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.zshrc to apply, or restart the terminal.
Verify Configuration

echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

If it outputs your API Key, the configuration is successful.

​

Step 3: Start Using Codex CLI

​

1. Enter working directory

cd your-working-directory

Note: Replace your-working-directory with actual path

​

2. Interactive mode

codex

​

3. Verify configuration

codex "Who are you"

Success indicators:

See AI response text (several lines)

No errors like 401, 403, API Key invalid

If you see errors:

401 Unauthorized: API Key not set or invalid → Check environment variable

403 Forbidden: Insufficient API Key permissions → Verify API Key

Network error: Network issue → Check connection

​

FAQ

​

1. What is Codex CLI and what is it used for?

Codex CLI is OpenAI’s official command-line tool focused on code-related tasks. It emphasizes engineering-ready output with clearer, actionable code changes.

​

2. How do I verify installation and configuration on first use?

Run these commands in sequence:

node -v and npm -v: Confirm Node.js and npm are installed

codex --version: Confirm Codex CLI is installed

codex "Who are you": Confirm API configuration is correct

​

3. What’s the difference between interactive mode and single command mode?

Interactive mode: Run codex to enter continuous conversation for multi-turn interactions

Single command mode: Run codex "question" to get a single response and exit

​

4. Will Codex CLI automatically read or upload my local files and code?

No. Codex CLI only reads file content when you explicitly reference or authorize it. It’s recommended to use it in a dedicated project folder.

​

5. How do I use Codex CLI to analyze local file content?

In interactive mode, you can reference files by:

Typing the file path for Codex to read

Dragging files into the terminal window

Copy and pasting file content

​

6. Does Codex CLI support Chinese input and output?

Yes, fully supported.

​

7. No output after execution—what could be the cause?

Common causes include:

Network connection issues

Invalid API Key or insufficient balance

Incorrect base_url configuration

Firewall or proxy blocking requests

​

8. Why don’t my config changes take effect?

Restart your terminal

Check config.toml syntax (TOML format)

Verify config file path:

Windows: C:\Users\{username}\.codex\config.toml

macOS / Linux: ~/.codex/config.toml

​

9. What causes 401/403 errors?

401 error: OPENAI_API_KEY not set or invalid

403 error: Insufficient permissions or expired key

Check that env_key matches your environment variable name

​

10. What scenarios is Codex CLI suited for?

Suited for:

Code writing, debugging, and refactoring

Quick Q&A in command-line environments

File content analysis

Not suited for:

Complex GUI interactions

Real-time collaborative editing

​

11. How do I switch models?

Open the configuration file config.toml (located at ~/.codex/config.toml or C:\Users\{username}\.codex\config.toml), and modify the model field:

model = "gpt-5.2"  # Change to your desired model name

Save the file and restart Codex CLI for changes to take effect.

​

12. How do I upload images?

Option 1: Reference the image path

Option 2: Drag and drop an image into the terminal

Option 3: Paste an image directly

All methods require user action—Codex CLI will not automatically read or upload local images.

​

13. How to open command line terminal?

Method 1: Press Win + R, type cmd or powershell, then press Enter

Method 2: Search for “Command Prompt” or “PowerShell” in the Start menu

Method 3: Hold Shift and right-click in a folder, select “Open PowerShell window here”

Method 1: Press Command + Space to open Spotlight, type Terminal, then press Enter

Method 2: Go to “Applications” → “Utilities” → “Terminal”

Method 1: Press Ctrl + Alt + T shortcut

Method 2: Search for “Terminal” in the application menu

​

Notes

Run Codex CLI in a dedicated project folder. Avoid running it in sensitive directories (such as system folders or directories containing credentials). Codex CLI operates starting from the current working directory.
The wire_api in config must be set to "responses". "chat" is deprecated.
